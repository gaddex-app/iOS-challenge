# iOS-challenge

The goal for this challenge is evaluate your coding and product mindset skills, so you are free to take any decission by your own. The most important thing is trust on yourself, trust on your ideas and your knowledge.
Is not necessary have a complete and perfect test, is more important have a clear idea about what you are doing and why!

# To Keep in mind âœ¨
  - Use a good architecture 
  - Add some tests to check how do you work with that
  - Keep in mind SOLID principles
  - Fork this project and upload your test to Github, to check how you work with Git
  - Record a video and include on your repository
  - The app should run on any computer using the last version of XCode, Swift and iOS.
  - We'll evaluate the exercise by looking commits and test passed.
